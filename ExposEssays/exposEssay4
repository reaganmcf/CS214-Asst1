Davidson’s Power Through Context
	Growing up, we are constantly told that, “You are responsible for your own actions.” Throughout every day, we make an absurd number of decisions and take millions of actions. Some of these decisions and actions are minuscule and have no major consequences, but some cause repercussions that affect the rest of our lives. While we grow up being told that we are solely responsible for these actions we take and decisions we make, Malcolm Gladwell introduces an idea that contradicts our notion of our personal responsibility towards the consequences of our actions. Malcolm Gladwell discusses the effects of external factors on the actions of individuals in his article “The Power of Context: Bernie Goetz and the Rise and Fall of New York City Crime”. Cathy Davidson’s article, “Project Classroom Makeover”, criticizes the current education system and proposes possible solutions to the problems at hand. Surprisingly, Davidson’s solutions use ideas that are synonymous to Gladwell’s theories. Davidson’s view of education and the way she goes about invoking change is strongly influenced by Gladwell’s ideas of the Power of Context, Law of the Few, and Stickiness.
	In the early 1970’s, an experiment now known as the Stanford Prison Experiment resulted in outcomes that strongly support Malcolm Gladwell’s theory of the Power of Context. The Stanford Prison Experiment took normal people leading normal lives and put them in a simulated prison and they went insane. Gladwell states, “There are instances where you can take normal people from good schools and happy families and good neighborhoods and powerfully affect their behavior merely by changing the immediate details of their situation,” (Gladwell, 159). Regardless of the personal characteristics of individual people, just by changing the environment that surrounds them, their behaviors can be completely altered. Davidson used the same tactics discussed by Gladwell to elevate the education standards at Duke University. In the experimental prison, the guards, who were essentially just normal people given a uniform, were given freedom and were blinded by it as a result of the Power of Context. The guard’s new context was an environment with freedom with lack of repercussions for their actions, and the power they received from this was that they were feared by the prisoners. Gladwell’s conjecture of the Power of Context was clearly at play here: a negative change in the environment of the normal people chosen for the experiment resulted in huge negative changes in behavior. Similar to the Stanford Prison Experiment, she believed that normal people, when given technology, can flourish educationally. Davidson believed that by using the same logic, but in a beneficial way, she could cause a positive change in the context in a student’s life and therefore, gift them with the power of better education. Therefore, Davidson supplied the whole incoming freshman class with iPods. Davidson’s way of changing the context of her students was to incorporate technology in the classroom. In the end, her positive change in the student’s environment resulted in positive strides towards a better education standard. Davidson says, “Because everyone had the device, sound suddenly had a new educational role in our text- and visuals-dominated classroom culture,” (Davidson, 52). This change in environment of students to a tech centered classroom is similar to the normal people being put into a prison with too much freedom. All the school did was supply the students with the iPods and then step out of the way and allow them to use them in any way they pleased or saw fit. Immediately, positive changes in the way students were absorbing information could be seen. Duke created a new standard of education simply by making a slight change to the context of the day to day lives of students. The context changed as a result of the scientists who carried out the experiment and Davidson. These people are small groups or individuals that took an action that resulted in a broad impact, which greatly impacted the environment.
	John F. Kennedy once said, “One person can make a difference” and this can be seen through the Law of the Few. Gladwell’s theory of the Law of the Few states that one small group or individual can invoke action or change indirectly even without any active form of persuasion. For example, when Goetz shot the four african american teenagers on the subway, he, unknowingly, started a discussion about street crime in New York City. While his action was spontaneous and unplanned, it had many more consequences than one would expect. The incident became a national story and people all around the country were labeling Goetz as an “avenging angel,” (Gladwell, 150). His action unintentionally spiraled into a discussion of crime in New York City. As a result, Goetz can be considered part of the “few”. Similarly, Davidson is considered the “few” because she is talking about reform in the education system. Davidson is one person who is discussing change in the education system without actively telling people to fight for change. The people that hear her message are “powerfully and imperceptibly influenced”, even if they hear it on the news or through short conversations with others (Gladwell, 157). Just like Goetz, Davidson is one person changing, rather than the whole system changing. Rather than setting up an organization of people to fight for an educational reform, Davidson just voices her own opinions. Davidson’s charisma is what allowed her opinion to influence the people that heard them. By giving Duke students iPods and showing positive results, Davidson became a trusted person of authority and she used this power to unconsciously influence others to heed her ideas. As a result, she can clearly be considered part of the “few”. However, Goetz and Davidson’s ideas become popular because they are sticky. When people heard these ideas, they stuck with them unintentionally.
Stickiness unintentionally plays a huge role in everyone’s life. According to Gladwell, a sticky idea is an idea, which may seem small or unimportant at first, that is actually very unforgettable and subconsciously pushes a person to take action. Gladwell proves this theory by explaining an experiment where people who are asked to give a talk on being a good person are restricted by time and do not help people in need on the street. The problem with stickiness is that, many times, people will unintentionally say something that ends up sticking to the person hearing it. For example, students who are labeled as “slow” or “dumb” as a young child in school are destined to take that personally and continue to not do well in school. While every student has the potential to do better and work harder, teachers are suppressing this ability by telling them that they cannot do so at a young age when they do not know better. Therefore, we need more teachers like Mrs. Inez Davidson who understand the potential of their students and work with them to do better. For example, Mrs. Davidson worked with Rodney, a student that other teachers labeled as “slow” at math, and helped him excel to the top of his class in his so called weakest subject. Mrs. Davidson understood the theory of stickiness and the negative affects of teachers calling students slow and tried to reverse its affects. While other teachers would repress their students by telling them that they were not as smart, Mrs. Davidson encouraged all of her students with positive reinforcement.  In this way, she would undo the affects of negative sticky ideas with the use of positive sticky ideas. This can be done simply by “Changing the content of communication, by making a message so memorable that it sticks in someone’s mind and compels them to action,” (Gladwell, 161). A student that is incorrectly labeled as having a learning disability when they do not understand math and science at a young age should rather be considered something positive that focuses on one of their stronger skills. This will allow them to take action and work towards something that they are actually good at, rather than wasting time thinking that they are not good at math. By avoiding attaching negative labels to students that will inevitably stick to them and affect them in the long run, the education system would quickly become much more formidable in comparison to other countries.
Davidson incorporates Gladwell’s three main ideas throughout her article and bases her solutions off of them. Davidson uses the Power of Context to show that by changing the context of a students education, the country can quickly move towards a better education system. Additionally, as a result of her strong position on the need to improve education, Davidson is considered the “few”. Lastly, Davidson endorses teachers that positively reinforce their students due to the idea of Stickiness. Gladwell strongly believes that the environment that surrounds a person will strongly influence any actions they take. On the other hand, many people disagree with the ideas of Gladwell where external factors are what result in either a person’s downfall or success. Many people believe that hard work can always trump the environmental and contextual factors of a person’s life. For example, a person that is born and raised in a neighborhood infested with crime and low quality schooling can definitely work hard and become successful in whatever field they wish. It can be somewhat depressing to think that regardless of what actions we take, the environment we are in will always take precedence in influencing our actions so I would like to think that while our environment will always play a large role, hard work and motivation can allow a person to take any action they would like.
